# THE GLITCH APP & WEBSITE INTEGRATION PLAN

## 🎯 **GOAL: Real-time Synchronization Between App & Website**

### **Current Status:**
- ✅ Flutter app is running in Chrome
- ⏳ Backend is starting up
- ✅ Database schema fixed
- ✅ API endpoints configured

---

## 🔄 **REAL-TIME INTEGRATION FEATURES**

### **1. Shared Database (MySQL)**
Both the website and app will use the **same MySQL database**:

```sql
-- Main Tables:
- users (shared user accounts)
- courses (shared course data)
- channels (shared community channels)
- messages (shared community messages)
- user_courses (shared enrollments)
- levels (shared user levels)
```

### **2. Real-time Features**

#### **A. User Authentication Sync**
- **Register on app** → Account available on website
- **Login on website** → Session works on app
- **Password change** → Works on both platforms
- **Profile updates** → Sync across both

#### **B. Community Chat Sync**
- **Messages sent on app** → Appear on website
- **Messages sent on website** → Appear on app
- **Real-time updates** via WebSocket
- **Admin message deletion** → Works on both

#### **C. Course Enrollment Sync**
- **Enroll on app** → Shows on website
- **Purchase on website** → Available on app
- **Progress tracking** → Shared across platforms

#### **D. Admin Panel Sync**
- **User management** → Changes reflect on both
- **Message moderation** → Works on both
- **Analytics** → Combined data from both platforms

CORS: Enabled for both domains
```

### **Frontend (React Website)**
```
Port: 3000
API: http://localhost:8080/api
WebSocket: ws://localhost:8080/ws
```

### **Mobile App (Flutter)**
```

## 📱 **USER EXPERIENCE**

### **Seamless Cross-Platform Experience:**

1. **User registers on app** → Can immediately login on website
2. **User joins community on website** → Messages appear on app
3. **User enrolls in course on app** → Can access on website
4. **Admin deletes message on website** → Disappears from app
5. **Real-time notifications** → Work on both platforms

### **Data Consistency:**
- ✅ Single source of truth (MySQL database)
- ✅ Real-time synchronization
- ✅ No data conflicts
- ✅ Consistent user experience

## 🔧 **API ENDPOINTS (Shared)**

### **Authentication:**
```
POST /api/auth/login
POST /api/auth/register
POST /api/auth/forgot-password
POST /api/auth/reset-password
```

### **Community:**
```

GET /api/community/channels/{id}/messages
POST /api/community/channels/{id}/messages
DELETE /api/community/messages/{id}
WebSocket: /ws/chat?token={jwt}&channelId={id}
```

### **Courses:**
```
GET /api/courses

DELETE /api/users/{id}
GET /api/admin/messages
DELETE /api/admin/messages/{id}
```
